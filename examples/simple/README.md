# Tuber-simple

Example of using tuber to send messages between a web app's main UI thread and a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

This example uses [trunk](https://github.com/trunk-rs/trunk). To start it up, use `trunk serve --release` then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and check the console.
